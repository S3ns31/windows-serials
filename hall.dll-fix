About “HAL.dll is missing or corrupt”

The following information on this error has been compiled by NeoSmart Technologies, based on the information gathered and reported by our global network of engineers, developers, and technicians or partner organizations.
Description and Symptoms

The error messages, alerts, warnings, and symptoms below are tied to this error.
Symptom 1: “HAL is missing, or corrupt” error screen on startup

The HAL(Hardware Abstraction Layer) serves as an interface between a system’s hardware and software, providing a consistent hardware platform on which to run applications. When a HAL is employed, applications do not access hardware directly but access the abstract layer provided by the HAL. For example, responding to an interrupt is quite different on a machine with an Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC) than on one without. The HAL provides a single function for this purpose that works with all kinds of interrupts by various chipsets, so that other components need not be concerned with the differences. In Windows, HAL is implemented in hal.dll, and when this file is either missing on corrupt, the boot process halts, and a error screen is displayed.

Here is an example of “HAL is missing or corrupt” error screen for Windows XP:

Hal.dll Win XP error screen

Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:
<Windows root>\system32\hal.dll.
Please re-install a copy of the above file.

And here is an example of “HAL is missing or corrupt” error screen for Windows Vista and Windows 7:

Hal.dll Win Vista+ error screen

Windows Boot Manager

Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the 
cause. To fix the problem:

   1. Insert your Windows installation disc and restart your computer.
   2. Choose your language settings, and then click "Next."
   3. Click "Repair your computer."

If you do not have this disc, contact your system administrator or computer 
manufacturer for assistance

     File: \Windows\system32\hal.dll
     Status: 0xc0000221
     Info: Windows failed to load because the HAL is missing, or corrupt.

The “Status” 0x code and the “Info” text may differ, but the file in question is always \Windows\system32\hal.dll
Causes of this Error

This error has been known to occur as a result of one of the following causes:
Cause 1: Invalid BOOT.INI file configuration

On Windows XP and other operating systems using the NTLDR bootloader, the boot.ini file configuration could be either changed or become incorrect. This consequently means the ARC paths in the [operating systems] section or the default entry in BOOT.INI are incorrect. This can happen if boot.ini is modified (inadvertently or maliciously), if the BIOS settings have changed, or if hardware (especially IDE, SATA, or SCSI disk drives) have been added or removed.
Cause 2: BCD configuration is incorrect

Invalid data in BOOTMGR’s boot configuration data file (BCD) can cause this error to be present on Windows Vista and Windows 7. Hal.dll is required for the Windows kernel to communicate with the underlying hardware in a platform-agnostic fashion. Incorrect data in the BCD will cause BOOTMGR to load Windows with the wrong system root set, and hal.dll will not be found. This will cause the “HAL is missing or corrupt” error to appear.
Cause 3: The hal.dll file is in fact corrupted or missing

Failed Windows Updates or Automatic Updates to Windows that involve an upgrade of critical system files (especially service pack installations) that update hal.dll may result in this error. If hal.dll is not written to the disk correctly, or an incompatible version of hal.dll is used, then “HAL is missing or corrupt” error may appear.
Cause 4: File system integrity compromised

The hard drive’s file system may become damaged because of disk write errors, power outages or virus attacks. If that’s the case, the operating system cannot find hal.dll to boot properly and the loading process is halted.
Fixing “Hal.dll is missing or corrupt” on Windows

Windows Setup CD/DVD Required!

Fix #2: Manually attempt rebuild of boot.ini

A boot.ini file is used by Windows to configure and display its operating system options. Instructions on manually recreating the boot.ini file are also available, but require a moderate level of computer expertise. The instructions below will guide you on recreating boot.ini automatically from the Windows XP setup CD.

Unable to boot into the Windows setup CD?
See our guide on setting up a PC to boot from the CD or DVD for troubleshooting and more detailed instructions.

    Insert your Windows XP CD and restart your computer.
    Press a key to boot into the CD when you see the “Press any key to boot from CD” message.
    When you arrive at the “Welcome to Setup” message, press R to start the Recovery Console.
    Type in your Administrator password; hit Enter
    The next command you need to write is below; hit Enter afterwards:

    bootcfg /rebuild

The above command, bootcfg /rebuild, will scan your computer for installed Windows copies. If you have Windows XP, here are the next steps:

    Press Y if the command prompt shows a message similar to the one below:

    Total Identified Windows Installs: 1

    [1] C:\Windows
    Add installation to boot list? (Yes/No/All)

    When you receive a message like this:

    Enter Load Identifier

    You are being asked to provide a name to be assigned and shown in the boot menu for the installation you picked in the previous step. Examples:

    Enter Load Identifier: Windows XP Professional (Recovered)

    (Optional) When you receive a message like this:

    Enter OS Load options

    Type in /fastdetect followed by Enter
    Restart your computer.
